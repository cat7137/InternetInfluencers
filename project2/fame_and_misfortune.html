                <h2>Internet Influencer's Newfound Stardom</h2>
                <p>With the rise of social media and the majority of people today having some type of it, it’s really easy for almost anyone to gain popularity. Oftentimes these days, many people end up posting a video on a platform like Tiktok or Youtube, and end up becoming an internet trend or meme. This can cause people from being an average, 9-5 working class person to a social media star in just mere days. This can be a good thing, as it helps people be able to follow their dreams more than being stuck at a job they wish they weren’t in. When people become famous, they then have the time and effort to put into things they’ve always wanted to do. This leads people who became famous on one app to start diving into other mainstreams like music, acting, or dancing. An example of this is Conan Gray. He started off posting random videos of himself in college on Youtube, and eventually started posting song covers on the platform as well. He then started to make music and gained more and more popularity from his music. He now has 20 million monthly listeners on Spotify. </p>

                <h2>Cancel Culture</h2>
                <p>Being an influencer comes with a price. The bigger your fanbase the less privacy you have. If you aren’t careful you can be “canceled” and it could impact your career. One of the most famous “cancellations” was back in 2016, a time called “Dramageddon.” “On May 10, 2019, a bitter war broke out when beauty YouTuber Tati Westbrook released an explosive video accusing her former friend and YouTube star James Charles of being backstabbing and manipulative.”<a href="references.html">(Dodgson)</a> This was one of the first big cancellations and it cost the Youtuber James Charles to lose 3 million subscribers from his channel in just a couple days. “The 19-year-old YouTube beauty blogger had around 16.5 million subscribers Friday, according to the website Social Blade. That number had fallen to about 13.8 million by Monday afternoon and shows no signs of slowing down.” <a href="references.html">(Kaur)</a> Since then many influencers have been “canceled” for a variety of different reasons, some truthful and for good reason, and others just for rumors that were false. </p>
