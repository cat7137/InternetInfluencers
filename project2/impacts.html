                        <h2>Impacts on Media</h2>
                        <p>When it comes to social media, there is a wide variety of ways to become an influencer nowadays. Each social media platform - Youtube, Tiktok, Instagram, etc., has its own “type” of influencers. On Youtube, influencers gain followers by uploading longer videos to draw the attention of the fan base they are creating for. On Tiktok, influencers create shorter, 7 second videos. Instagram influencers gain their popularity just from posting pictures on the app. Some influencers even gain popularity cross-platform. For example, a Tiktoker named Brittany Broski, also known as “Kombucha girl” has now started a Podcast that you can watch on Youtube titled “The Broski Report” which currently has 451 thousand subscribers on the platform.  <a href="references.html">(Youtube)</a></p>

                    <h2>Impacts on the People</h2>
                    <p>More people listen to internet influencers who post more often than news outlets, especially if their views align with theirs. Internet Influencers do just that- influence. They are able to get people to listen to what they say and do something about it. It could be for the good - bringing awareness to certain things happening in the world, or they could use it to advertise products. “Research on the social influence of social media influencers has found evidence for the potential that social media influencers have to exert informational and normative social influence over their readers, receivers or followers with regard to brands and products…firstly, because they both exert influence with the content they create for a large number of followers (Shan et al., [85]) and, secondly, because they function as opinion leaders who influence consumers' product decisions and evaluations (Shan et al., [85]).” <a href="references.html">(Ouvrein)</a></p>
