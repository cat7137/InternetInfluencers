                    <h2>How Influencers Make Money</h2>
                    <p>Influencers are pretty much entrepreneurs. They make a majority of their money off donations people give them or through brand deals companies offer if they are popular enough. 
                “Ryan Kaji, a 10-year-old "kidfluencer" who mostly discusses toys, earned nearly $30 million in 2020 from advertising and $200 million from his own merchandise line, and Kylie Jenner, ‘the highest earning influencer on Instagram, is reportedly paid around $1.2 million per post.’” <a href="references.html">(Yallop)</a> Most influencers tend to start their own businesses/brands to make more of a profit from their online popularity. “As creators gain more experience with marketing and business, we see them shift from solely working with brands to creating their own. Many influencers create their own product lines, promoting their own services, brands and social media, resulting in a greater diversification in revenue streams and overall opportunities.” <a href="references.html">(Admin.)</a> Not only are the influencers names/alias’ their brand, but some make products to sell as well. For example, Emma Chamberlain got internet fame from her Youtube channel, and was known for always drinking coffee. She then started her own coffee brand, “Chamberlain Coffee.” </p>
